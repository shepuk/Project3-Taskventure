Taskventure is an RPG inspired task-tracking app powered by Flask & MongoDB. Track quests, choose a hero, battle enemies and collect treasures.

### Live Project

[View the live project here.](https://taskventure.herokuapp.com/)

### Backend Project

Built with backend technilogy in mind, Taskventure utilises primarilly Python, Flask and MongoDB, along with several other packages outlined in the [technologies](#technologies) section below.

### Primary Objectives

 - Design and implement a backend for a web application using Python and a micro-framework.
 - Model and manage data.
 - Query and manipulate data.
 - Deploy to a cloud platform.
 - Identify and apply security features.

### Early ideas & goals

 - Design and build a task-tracking app with a deep set of additional features.
 - Implement database CRUD functionality into the design.
 - Design a databse in which fields can be compared against each other. 
 - Create a varied & fun experience with longevity in mind.
 - The content should be justified, accessible, responsive and presented logically.

- #### Testing the code
 - Throughout the project, I used validator tools to find and fix various typos or errors in my code.
    - [JSLint](https://www.jslint.com/)
    - [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
    - [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)

## Setup, Backups & Depoyment
[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used as my primary IDE.
A template was provided by Code Institute which I cloned for my project repository.
Opening the repository in Gitpod is made simple thanks to a [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-always-ready-to-co/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki).

Git / Github were used for file versioning and hosting.
git add . was used initially to add my files and folders to the staging area, followed by git commit -m "Initial commit" and git push to finally add them to my Github repository.
Throughout the project, I was careful to use Git often and tried to make commits as descriptive as possible as well.

Once completed, I used Heroku to host and run the application:
